# Fire Mapping

## Description

The Better Working World Data Challenge is one of the ways we live our purpose at EY. The Challenge will contribute to our ambition to positively affect the lives of 1 billion people in our communities by 2030 and create long-term value. With our global breadth and depth and industry alliances, EY is uniquely positioned to bring together world-class organizations with students and young professionals to help solve society’s biggest challenges.

In this challenge we will use airborne infrared linescan supplied by Forest Fire Management Victoria (Australia) and satellite data supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA to help tackle climate change and the fight against bushfires. The solutions from the Challenge will help to reduce fatalities, damage and trauma by allowing fire authorities to answer critical questions, such as who they need to warn and what locations need to be evacuated.
